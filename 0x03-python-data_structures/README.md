Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
0. print_list_integer.py: function that prints all integers of a list
1. 1-element_at.py: python function that retrieves an element from a list If idx is negative, the function should return None
2. 2-replace_in_list.py: a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C). If idx is negative, the function should not modify anything, and returns the original list
3. 3-print_reversed_list_integer.py: a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
4. 4-new_in_list.py: a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
5. 5-no_c.py: a function that removes all characters c and C from a string. The function should return the new string
6. 6-print_matrix_integer.py: a function that prints a matrix of integers.
7. 7-add_tuple.py: a function that adds 2 tuples. Returns a tuple with 2 integers:
The first element should be the addition of the first element of each argument
The second element should be the addition of the second element of each argument
8. 8-multiple_returns.py: a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
9. 9-max_integer.py: a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
10. 10-divisible_by_2.py: a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list. Return a new list with True or False, depending on whether the integer at the same position in the original list is a multiple of 2
11. 11-delete_at.py: a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list. If idx is negative or out of range, nothing change (returns the same list)
12. 12-switch.py: Python program that switches the values of variable a and b
13. 13-is_palindrome.c: a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome. Return: 0 if it is not a palindrome, 1 if it is a palindrome
14. 100-print_python_list_info.c: C function that prints basic information about Python lists
